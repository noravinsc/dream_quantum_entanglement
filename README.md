# dream_quantum_entanglement
A big open source and interesting and worthy project to all of us, hope that every one of us can do this project seriously. This project's target is to analysis the link between our dream and our world, and to see wether the link between our dream and our world conform to the quantum entanglement theory.

Please do this project as followes:

1.You must do this seriously.

2.You must draw the picture as clearly as possible that just appeared in your dream and never appeared in your true life, and you should append the information of  time and place to the name of the picture that the picture appeared of yourself.

3.You should put the picture in the dreams_picture file folder.

4.Others who saw the picture that others put in the dreams_picture file folder that appeared in your dreams or ture life, should write down the information that the picture appeared in your dream or true life, the time and place when and where you are that you saw this picture except in this dreams_picture folder, and split the information with ***, and you shold put the information in the dreams_showed file folder use text and name it with the same name to the picture.

Our future work and confidence to this project:

1.In our future works we will do some statistic works to the picture informations to study whether the picture that just showed in your dream can appear in other people's dream or true life, to study whether the dreams has some links between our ture world, and what is the link to the end, and to study whether the link can show some feature that similar to the theory quantum entanglement.

2.I think this project is amazing and interesting , and this project has extraordinary significance to everyone of us, and everyone of us can join this big project without any complex requirements, and every one of us can do a very big contribute to our world.

3.Do you want to join in this big project? Do you interested in this big project? If the answer is yes, join in! Thank you!
